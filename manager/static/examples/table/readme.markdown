Table
===================

A `table` is an associative collection that maps a set of unique indices
to other values. The same way as for sets, the `delete` operator is used to remove
elements, however, adding elements is done just by assigning to an index as shown in this code example.

Set and table are comparable to array and hash or map in other languages.

Run the example. Most of it is the same as for sets. You can experiment with searching in sets and tables for example.
