Variables
===========

You can assign arbitrary data to a variable in order to store it for later use.
A ‘local’ variable differs from a ‘global’ in that its 
scope is restricted to the body of a function 
if its declared within one and will be assigned an initial 
value each time the function body is executed. 
You typically won’t see local variables declared outside the body of functions 
unless it’s example code or possibly work-in-progress code that 
may later be moved into a function, but is currently freely floating inside 
some small script just for quick testing purposes.

The reference on declaring variables, constants, functions etc is found 
[here](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/script-reference/statements.html).
More on types and all things that can be declared will follow in later chapters of this
tutorial.

Run the example for this exercise. Try to print 'z' in the second event. Does that work?
