Exercise 1
==========================

Now that we have types, operators, functions, loops and logic control we can 
go into a first exercise.

As you have seen before Bro supports pattern matching. 
Pattern matching can be a powerful tool especially in the area of network debugging and security.
Finding specific things in logs is an efficient way might make a change in many situations.

*  Write a program to remove every letter "e" from an arbitrary string
   of your choosing (does not have to be done in-place).

*  Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for
   multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the
   multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of
   both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

The solution to this exercise follows on the next page.
