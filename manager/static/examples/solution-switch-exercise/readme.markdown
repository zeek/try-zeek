Switch Exercise: Solution
==========================================

Write a program that relies on a switch statement to count the
number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in an arbitrary string of your

We loop through the string that is given in the variable `input`.
Inside the for loop every character is sent to the switch to test if it is a vowel. If so, the 
variable `result` is incremented.
